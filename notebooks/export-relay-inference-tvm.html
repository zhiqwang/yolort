<p>This article is an introductory tutorial to deploy PyTorch YOLOv5 models with Relay VM.</p>
<p>For us to begin with, PyTorch should be installed. TorchVision is also required since we will be using it as our model zoo.</p>
<p>A quick solution is to install via pip</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">torch</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="m">1</span>.10.1
pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">torchvision</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="m">0</span>.11.2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or please refer to official site <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/</a></p>
<p>PyTorch versions should be backwards compatible but should be used with the proper TorchVision version.</p>
<p>Currently, Only test <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TVM</span></code> with PyTorch 1.7.x and 1.10.x, other versions may be unstable.</p>
<p>And this notebook is running on macOS M1.</p>
