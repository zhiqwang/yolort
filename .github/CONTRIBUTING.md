## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Development installation

### Install PyTorch and TorchVision

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
# or with pip (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
# pip install numpy
# pip install torch torchvision
```

### Install yolort

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolort.git
cd yolov5-rt-stack
pip install -e .
```

## Development Process

If you plan to modify the code or documentation, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you have modified the code (new feature or bug-fix), please add unit tests.
1. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation. Make sure the documentation builds.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code passes the formatting checks.

### Code formatting

Contributions should be compatible with Python 3.X versions and be compliant with PEP8. We have already installed the [pre-commit service](https://github.com/apps/pre-commit-ci) to auto fix the pull requests. If you want to check the codebase locally, please either run

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

or run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

once to perform these checks automatically before every `git commit`. If `pre-commit` is not available you can install it with

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Unit tests

If you have modified the code by adding a new feature or a bug-fix, please add unit tests for that. To run a specific test:

```bash
pytest test/<test-module.py> -vvv -k <test_myfunc>
# e.g. pytest test/test_models.py -vvv -k test_load_from_yolov5
```

If you would like to run all tests:

```bash
pytest test -vvv
```

### Documentation

TBD

### Pull Request Recommendations

If all previous checks (flake8, mypy, unit tests) are passing, please send a PR. Submitted PR will pass other tests on different operation systems, python versions and hardwares. To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:

- :white_check_mark: Verify your PR is **up-to-date with upstream/main**. You could update your PR to upstream/main by running the following code, don't forget replacing 'feature' with the name of your local branch:

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack.git
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main
  git checkout -b feature  # <--- REPLACE 'feature' WITH YOUR LOCAL BRANCH NAME
  # ADD YOUR PROPOSED CHANGES HERE
  git add .
  git commit -m "YOUR REVISION MESSAGE"
  git push origin feature
  ```

- :white_check_mark: Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.

- :white_check_mark: Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_ â€” Bruce Lee
